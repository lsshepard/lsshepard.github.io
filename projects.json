        "priority": 1000,
        "description": "ML model that optimizes concrete proportions. Consists of a neural net and a customizable objective function. The NN models the relation between concrete ingredient proportions and properties. The objective function is configured from a GUI to reflect the concrete technologists requirements. The concrete mix is then optimized by using the gradients of the ingredient proportions with regard to the objective function.",

Developed algorithms and datastructures for opening / closing positions, adjusting liquidity, liquidating positions, swaps, etc.. All algorithms had O(lgn) computational complexity and O(n) storage complexity (or better). Intended for low-cap volatile blockchain assets. Ultimately discontinued after considering economic ramifications; regulation of financial derivatives exist for a reason. Fun exercise in algorithm design though.",
